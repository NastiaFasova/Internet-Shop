and. It reproduces the main functions and opportunities 
of online shopping.

* view the main menu
* view the products

#### Functions available only for users with a USER-role:
* add products to your bucket
* delete products from your bucket
* make orders
* view the list of all your orders
* view the details of your order

#### Functions available only for users with a ADMIN-role:
* add products to the store
* delete products from the store

In order to add some security and give the access to appropriate resources,
depending on the role,
authentication and authorization filters were implemented. 

In addition, DAO, Service layers, Servlets and JSP pages are absent.

DAO layer has two implementations which gives you a possibility to test it both
on inner storage and on storage based on MySQL DataDase.
